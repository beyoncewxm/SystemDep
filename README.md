System Dependencies
Components of computer systems often have dependencies­­other components that must
be installed before they will function properly. These dependencies are frequently shared
by multiple components. For example, both the TELNET client program and the FTP
client program require that the TCP/IP networking software be installed before they can
operate. If you install TCP/IP and the TELNET client program, and later decide to add
the FTP client program, you do not need to reinstall TCP/IP.
